        "\n",
        "Measures of central tendency are statistical tools used to describe the center of a dataset. They help us understand the typical or average value within a set of data points. The three primary measures of central tendency are:\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Mean:-** The mean, or average, is calculated by summing all the values in a dataset and dividing by the total number of values.\n",
        "\n",
        "**When to Use:** The mean is appropriate when the data is normally distributed (bell-shaped) and there are no significant outliers. It's sensitive to extreme values.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "Consider the following dataset of test scores: 85, 92, 78, 95, 88.\n",

        "Mean = (85 + 92 + 78 + 95 + 88) / 5 = 87.6\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Median:-** The median is the middle value in a dataset when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order. If there's an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n",

        "**When to Use: **The median is useful when the data is skewed or has outliers. It's less affected by extreme values than the mean.\n",
